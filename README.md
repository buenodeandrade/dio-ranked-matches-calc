# DIO - Creating Games with Godot - Ranked Matches Calculator

## Project Description

In this project, you will create a Ranked Matches Calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to build a web application that allows users to input the number of victories and defeats of a player and calculates their ranking level based on the number of victories. This project will utilize variables, operators, loops, decision structures, and functions to achieve the desired functionality.

## Features
- Input fields for the number of victories and defeats
- Calculation of the balance of victories
- Display of the player's ranking level based on their number of victories
- A table showing the ranking levels and corresponding ranges of victories
- Retro gaming style design using custom fonts and CSS

## Tools and Concepts Used
- Variables
- Operators
- Loops
- Decision structures
- Functions
- HTML for structuring the web page
- CSS for styling the web page
- JavaScript for the logic and interactivity

## Objective
Create a function that receives the number of victories and defeats of a player as parameters. The function should calculate the balance of ranked matches using the formula (victories - defeats). Based on the number of victories, the function should determine the player's ranking level and display the appropriate message.

Ranking Levels:
- If victories < 10: Iron
- If victories between 11 and 20: Bronze
- If victories between 21 and 50: Silver
- If victories between 51 and 80: Gold
- If victories between 81 and 90: Diamond
- If victories between 91 and 100: Legendary
- If victories >= 101: Immortal

## Output
At the end, the application should display a message:
"The Hero has a balance of **{balance of victories}** and is at the **{level}** level"
